## Roadmap

To further this project, I would like to add some more functionality to the table by being able to sort by other categories, like the date of birth or adding a new category, location, to the table. I would like to add a feature where if the table row or photo is clicked, a modal pops up with more information about the employee. And I would like to add more to the presentation of the page, by adding up/down arrows to the table header if it is being sorted by that column and which direction. I would like to integrate more [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) into the application. And I would also like to explore adding a feature to extract the data into an excel or csv file.
